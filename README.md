### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Justin Friestad and this is my Github profile!
### Most of my work so far was done as an intern at IBM Monroe CIC and now I work at the CIC full-time. But here is where some extra work was done whether it was a hackathon, solo work, or work from when I was in school.
### 1. https://github.com/friestad/oxygen I worked on the front-end of this app. I was part of a five person team and we were given 48 hours. Myself and one other were solely front-end developers for it. We built it with React. It acts as a route-planner for events such as protests for Black Lives Matter. It integrates HERE's maps api to visualize routes and present data to users around them geographically. This is probably my cleanest front-end work I have because I spent all of those 48 hours only working with JavaScript and SCSS polishing components and building utilities to act as functions. We also deployed this to IBM Cloud.
### 2. https://github.com/friestad/KotlinKillersApp I worked on this for my software engineering capstone course in college at University of Louisiana Monroe. I worked on mostly frontend with some backend work. We built an app for AIMS an oil distributor in the area for their drivers to use to plan routes and send data back and forth through api endpoints.
